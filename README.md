I’m Himmat (pronounced HIM-it*), a full-stack software engineer with a passion for tackling complex problems and designing practical solutions. My background includes both technical and creative projects, most recently as a Software Engineer at Alkami Technology, where I developed and optimized over 20 UI screens and crafted a Groovy-based service to detect fraud for a digital banking platform with over 18.5 million active users. This role sharpened my expertise in secure, user-centered application design and further fueled my interest in applying AI to software architecture.

I’m currently exploring AI’s potential in development and architecture, eager to dive deeper into its real-world applications. My career began in education, where I gained a deep appreciation for communication, adaptability, and cultural connection. Having lived and worked abroad for over 13 years in India and Russia, I’ve developed a fascination with language, culture, and the power of connecting with people and environments.

I’m always open to learning new things and finding innovative ways to make meaningful impacts through my work. Let’s connect!

\* Himmat is a name of Punjabi and Persian origin, meaning Courage. The correct pronuncation could be difficult for the untrained tongue. The easiest way to get pretty close would be to say "HIMM" (just like the male pronoun) and then "utt" (like "what"!). If you know Gurmukhi/Punjabi, it's ਹਿੰਮਤ ; in Devanagri (Hindi), it's  हिम्मत ; and in Persian, it's همت . The pronunciations between each of those might vary slightly, but the origin and meaning are the same. 

As you can see, I love languages! Surprisingly, I've found a similar passion in learning to code in new languages for the computer to understand. What I have found is that you must understand what the listener/interpreter is hearing and how to communicate your message effectively. The process of learning and perfecting this requires empathy, humility and patience.
