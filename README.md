### < üëã Hello World >

My name is Himmat (basically pronounced HIM-it\*) ! I am a full-stack software engineer who enjoys solving logic problems. Being an engineer gives me the opportunity to find, understand and map out a path to solving a whole range of challenges. Every day, I love finding opportunities to learn new things!

My background is in education, having studied at graduate-level and worked for 6 years at an international boarding school. I have lived abroad in India and Russia for over 13 years of my life, and have found a fascination with language and culture. I love to travel and take time to connect with the environment and the people whom I meet.

\* Himmat is a name of Punjabi and Persian origin, meaning Courage. The correct pronuncation could be difficult for the untrained tongue. The easiest way to get pretty close would be to say "HIMM" (just like the male pronoun) and then "utt" (like "what"!). If you know Gurmukhi/Punjabi, it's ‡®π‡®ø‡©∞‡®Æ‡®§ ; in Devanagri (Hindi), it's  ‡§π‡§ø‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡§§ ; and in Persian, it's ŸáŸÖÿ™ . The pronunciations between each of those might vary slightly, but the origin and meaning are the same. 

As you can see, I love languages! Surprisingly, I've found a similar passion in learning to code in new languages for the computer to understand. What I have found is that you must understand what the listener/interpreter is hearing and how to communicate your message effectively. The process of learning and perfecting this requires empathy, humility and patience.
